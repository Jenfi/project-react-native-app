# Project React Native App ðŸ“±

In this week's project I have built my firt mobile application with React Native. I have kept it simple, focusing on getting to new React Native and Styled Components.

## Techniques and tools I used:
- React Native
- Styled components
- JSX
- State-hook and Effect-hook in React


## My process ðŸ§ 
- I got to know React Native documentation by reading up on the possibilites of it.
- I decided to use an API to fetch random jokes.
- I made a sketch of the project and what components to make.
- I had a look throught the API, to see what I wanted to fetch and use from it.
- I made a function which returns random numbers in order to use for the API call to get random jokes. 
- As a last step I styled some of the app using Styled Components. 

If I had more time I would have used some of the phone functions from React Native, for example making the phone vibrate each time you press the button.
